## Overview
**REPaL** is a framework to obtain a small language model based relation extractor for any target relation by distilling from a large language model. 
For any target relation (aka positive relation), we only assume the definition/description for that relation and an unlabeled relation instance corpus is given. 
REPaL works by (see the framework in the figure below): (1) synthesizing initial positive instances with the large language model and randomly sample from the unlabeled corpus as initial negative relation instances;
(2) fine-tune a small pre-trained language model with initial instances and conduct inference over the unlabeled corpus; (3) sample instances from the unlabeled corpus as feedback and use previous synthesis history as feedback for follow-up positive instance and negative instance synthesis (first synthesize negative relation definitions and then synthesize follow-up negative instances). 
Note that the more subsequent iterations can be conducted following the above procedure. 
Also note that we also synthesize the dev set data with the same size as train data for automatically picking the checkpoint for the fine-tuned relation extractor. 

For our defined **Definition Only Zero-Shot Relation Extraction Setting**, you will obtain a relation extractor for each relation with given definition. 
To convert it into the mutli-way relation classification setting, you can leverage the synthesized positive instances for a set of positive relations to train a multi-way relation classifier or decompose the multi-way classification task into multiple binary classification tasks (In this paper, we train the [KnowPrompt](https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowPrompt) with our synthesized data).

## Requirements

The codes are written in Python 3.8 (verified working on Python 3.11 as well). Please first install the required packages by the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Recommended GPU specification

The `roberta-large-mnli` backbone is fine-tuned in fp32 by default (no mixed precision), which uses roughly 5.6GB of fixed VRAM per relation (model weights + Adam optimizer states + gradients) before any activation memory. The original `scripts/run_init.sh` / `scripts/run.sh` batch sizes (`--eval_batch_size 3600`, `--unlabel_infer_batch_size 4200`) assume 4 large (>=24GB) GPUs.

| GPU VRAM | Works? | Recommended settings |
|---|---|---|
| CPU only | Not practical | Full 14/15-relation evaluation split can take many hours per pass; fine only for a quick single-relation smoke test with small batch sizes (`--eval_batch_size 16 --unlabel_infer_batch_size 16`). |
| ~8GB (e.g. RTX 4000, RTX 3070) | Yes, with adjustments | `--train_batch_size 8 --accum_steps 2` (keeps the paper's effective batch size of 16), `--eval_batch_size 128 --unlabel_infer_batch_size 128`, and `--use_amp` to enable mixed precision (roughly halves activation memory, also faster). |
| >=16GB (e.g. RTX 4080/4090, A4000 Ada, V100) | Yes | Paper's `--train_batch_size 16` works as-is; `--eval_batch_size`/`--unlabel_infer_batch_size` can go up to a few hundred without `--use_amp`, or match the paper's 3600/4200 on a single >=24GB GPU. |
| Multi-GPU (paper setup) | Yes | Original batch sizes as released; the code wraps the model in `torch.nn.DataParallel` automatically when `torch.cuda.device_count() > 1`. |

`--use_amp` (mixed-precision training via `torch.cuda.amp`) is opt-in and CUDA-only; it is a no-op on CPU.

If you use [`run_experiments.py`](run_experiments.py) instead of the shell scripts, pass `--device-profile {cpu,small_gpu,gpu}` (auto-detected from `torch.cuda.get_device_properties` when omitted) and it will apply the batch sizes and `--use_amp` above automatically.


## Datasets

Download data from [datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tGDTPhQ1-oy61lqSv00nJSP84Oai31I5?usp=sharing). 
Extract the `data.tar.gz` file (DefOn-FewRel and DefOn-WikiZSL) by
```
tar -xf data.tar.gz
```
and place the corresponding `data` folder under the current coda base `./`.

Extract the `reproduce_main_data.tar.gz` file (DefOn-FewRel and DefOn-WikiZSL for reproducing the main experiments) by 
```
tar -xf reproduce_main_data.tar.gz
```
and place the corresponding `data` folder under the `./reproduce/main`. 

You can adjust the `--dataset_dir` for running experiments over data in your specified folder.

    abstract = "Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relationships between entities within text. Despite considerable advancements, existing models predominantly require extensive annotated training data, which is both costly and labor-intensive to collect. Moreover, these models often struggle to adapt to new or unseen relations. Few-shot learning, aiming to lessen annotation demands, typically provides incomplete and biased supervision for target relations, leading to degraded and unstable performance. To accurately and explicitly describe relation semantics while minimizing annotation demands, we explore the definition only zero-shot RE setting where only relation definitions expressed in natural language are used to train a RE model. We introduce REPaL, comprising three stages: (1) We leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate initial seed instances from relation definitions and an unlabeled corpus. (2) We fine-tune a bidirectional Small Language Model (SLM) with initial seeds to learn relations for the target domain. (3) We expand pattern coverage and mitigate bias from initial seeds by integrating feedback from the SLM{'}s predictions on the unlabeled corpus and the synthesis history. To accomplish this, we leverage the multi-turn conversation ability of LLMs to generate new instances in follow-up dialogues, informed by both the feedback and synthesis history. Studies reveal that definition-oriented seed synthesis enhances pattern coverage whereas indiscriminately increasing seed quantity leads to performance saturation. Experiments on two datasets show REPaL significantly improved cost-effective zero-shot performance by large margins.",
